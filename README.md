# Spectral

A computational tool for simulating 3+1D deformations of nonlinear viscoelastic solids using the multidomain pseudospectral method. It is designed for modeling of nonlinear strain waves and solitons in (visco-) elastic waveguides.

### Features
- Simulates the evolution of initial waves and waves generated by pressure applied on the waveguide surface.
- Leverages the multidomain pseudospectral method with Legendre, Chebyshev or Fourier spatial basis for high accuracy and efficiency.
- Includes Jupyter notebooks for simulation and result visualization.

### Usage
Clone the repository and create a conda environment using the provided `spectral.yml` file.

The repository provides two examples:

1. **Evolution of an initial wave**  
   Use the notebook `SimulateIC` to simulate the evolution of an initial wave.

2. **Wave propagation generated by impact**  
   Use the notebook `SimulateImpact` to model strain waves resulting from an impact (a pressure applied to the waveguide's end for a short period of time).

To **visualize** the simulation results, refer to the `ResultsVisualization*` notebooks, which demonstrate post-processing and graphical representation of the data.

Example workflow:
1. Run the simulation notebook (`SimulateIC` or `SimulateImpact`) and save the results to a file.
2. Load the results using the corresponding `ResultsVisualization*` notebook for the simulation analysis.
