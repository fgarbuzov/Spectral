# Nonlinear Viscoelastic Simulator

This computational tool simulates 3+1D deformations of nonlinear viscoelastic waveguides using the multidomain pseudospectral method. It is designed for modeling of nonlinear strain waves and solitons.


## Features

- Simulate the evolution of initial waves and waves generated by impacts.
- Leverages a multidomain pseudospectral method for high accuracy and efficiency.
- Includes Jupyter notebooks for simulation and result visualization.


## Requirements

To set up the required environment, use the provided `spectral.yml` file with Conda.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f spectral.yml
   conda activate spectral
   ```


## Usage

The repository provides two examples for simulating wave propagation:

1. **Evolution of an Initial Wave**  
   Use the notebook `SimulateIC` to simulate the evolution of an initial wave.

2. **Wave Propagation Generated by Impact**  
   Use the notebook `SimulateImpact` to model waves resulting from an impact.

### Visualization of Results

To visualize the simulation results, refer to the `ResultsVisualization*` notebooks, which demonstrate post-processing and graphical representation of the data.


## Example Workflow

1. Open and run the simulation notebook (`SimulateIC` or `SimulateImpact`) to generate the results.
2. Use the corresponding `ResultsVisualization*` notebook to analyze and visualize the output.
